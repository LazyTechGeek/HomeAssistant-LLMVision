# Home Assistant LLM Vision

In this video, I show how to use LLM Vision in Home Assistant to analyse camera images, video clips, live streams, and timeline events.
We’ll install and configure LLM Vision, run through the available actions, and look at how it integrates with automations and tools like Frigate to turn camera events into clear, human-readable descriptions.
This is a longer step-by-step guide, so chapters are included to help you jump straight to the sections you need.
